		p
			| Welcome to the documentation for the datadriver API. Please note that <b>this API is not complete</b>. We don't
			| have any of the Appium bindings, for example, as well as many other methods. This project is a work in
			| progress.
		p
			| You should also be aware that you should consider this software as alpha. Naming conventions, how things work
			| under the hood and API additions will all be considered par for the course until we hit 1.0. If you have an
			| issue or a request, you can <a href="https://github.com/zdfs/datadriver/issues">file it here</a>.

		p
			| This configuration is only needed if you're using grunt-webdriver and datadriver <code>0.1.4</code>. If you're
			| using datadriver <code>0.2.0</code> and above, the following configuration is done for you in the
			| grunt-datadriver plugin.
		p
			| <b>Please note:</b> some of the API calls documented have changed since <code>0.1.4</code>. We encourage you
			| to use the latest version possible so that the documentation works as expected.
	p
		| Please note that the default output of Mocha's test runner treats everything like a test. If you click a button,
		| type some text in to a field (basically any executable action), they will be treated like "tests" and increase
		| your test count though no asserts are actually happening. For example:
	pre.language-bash.line-numbers
		code
			| $ grunt webdriver:home --url=http://duckduckgo.com
			| Running "webdriver:home" (webdriver) task
			| Duck Duck Go Test
			|   Rendered in a small viewport
			|     Search for DataDriver.io
			|       ✓ executing "setValue" on "#search_form_input_homepage".
			|       ✓ clicking the "#search_button_homepage" element.
			|       ✓ the "title" of this page should equal "Datadriver.io at DuckDuckGo"

		| If this bothers you, datadriver provides a custom Mocha reporter and Mocha UI that will give better feedback.
		| To enable it, just modify your <code>gruntfile.js</code> to include the <code>reporter</code> and <code>ui</code>
		| options.

			| var gruntConfig = {
			|   webdriver: {
			|     options: {
			|       desiredCapabilities: {
			|         browserName: 'chrome',
			|         name: 'Documentation Tests',
			|         viewports: {
			|           small: {
			|             width: 430,
			|             height: 1000
			|           },
			|           medium: {
			|             width: 700,
			|             height: 1000
			|           },
			|           large: {
			|             width: 1280,
			|             height: 1000
			|           }
			|         }
			|       },
			|       reporter: require('datadriver/lib/support/reporter'),
			|       ui: 'ddui'
			|     },
			|     home: {
			|       tests: ['tests/*.js']

	p Your test output should look something like the following (all API examples will use this format):
